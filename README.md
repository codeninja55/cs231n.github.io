# Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition Notes

DISCLAIMER: I did not create the materials in this repository. I would like to deeply thank the CS231n team for making these materials openly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/cs231n/cs231n.github.io) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv) under the MIT license.

Notes and assignments for Stanford CS class [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://vision.stanford.edu/teaching/cs231n/) with some additional changes to turn them into a PDF with proper LaTeX/MathJax rendering. I will also attempt, over time, to turn these notes into iPython/Jupyter notebooks with Python code to match where possible. I do not claim the code will work as necessary as I am only learning about this topic on my own.
